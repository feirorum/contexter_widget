# ASAP - As Soon As Possible

**As Soon As Possible** is a commonly used business term indicating urgency or the need for prompt action. It requests that a task be completed at the earliest available opportunity.

## Usage

ASAP is used in business communications to convey priority without specifying an exact deadline. However, it can be ambiguous as "as soon as possible" means different things to different people.

### Examples

- "Please send the report ASAP"
- "Need your feedback on this ASAP"
- "Fix the bug ASAP - it's blocking deployment"

## Best Practices

Instead of ASAP, consider:
- **Specific deadlines** - "by end of day" or "by 3pm tomorrow"
- **Priority levels** - "P0/Critical", "P1/High", etc.
- **Context** - Explain why it's urgent

## Etiquette

- Use sparingly to maintain impact
- Provide context when possible
- Consider time zones in global teams
- Follow up with actual deadline if needed

- [[COB]] - Close of Business
- [[ETA]] - Estimated Time of Arrival
