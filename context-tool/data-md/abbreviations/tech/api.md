# API - Application Programming Interface

An **Application Programming Interface** (API) is a set of protocols, tools, and definitions for building software applications. APIs define how software components should interact and enable different systems to communicate with each other.

## Key Concepts

APIs act as intermediaries that allow applications to request data or services from other applications, operating systems, or services. They abstract the underlying complexity and expose only the necessary functionality.

## Common Types

- **REST APIs** - Use HTTP methods and are stateless
- **GraphQL APIs** - Query language for flexible data fetching
- **SOAP APIs** - Protocol-based, more rigid structure
- **RPC APIs** - Remote procedure calls

## Use Cases

- Integrating third-party services (payment, maps, weather)
- Building microservices architectures
- Mobile app backend communication
- Public data access
- Internal service communication
