# LLM - Large Language Model

**Large Language Models** are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. They use deep learning techniques, particularly transformer architectures, to process and generate natural language.

## How They Work

LLMs are trained on billions of words from books, articles, websites, and other text sources. Through this training, they learn patterns in language, context, and even some reasoning capabilities.

### Key Characteristics

- **Scale** - Billions of parameters (GPT-4 has hundreds of billions)
- **Contextual understanding** - Can understand nuance and context
- **Generative** - Can create new, coherent text
- **Versatile** - Handle multiple tasks without specific training

## Popular LLMs

- **GPT-4** (OpenAI) - Most capable as of 2024
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - Focus on safety and helpfulness
- **Llama** (Meta) - Open-source alternative
- **Gemini** (Google) - Multimodal capabilities

## Applications

- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Content generation
- Code assistance
- Translation
- Summarization
- Question answering
