# Context Tool - Implementation TODO

This document contains detailed, step-by-step tasks for implementing the Text Selection Context Tool. Each task is written with enough detail for a code agent to execute independently.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Data Layer

### 1.1 Project Initialization
- [ ] **Task: Create project directory structure**
  - Create directory `context-tool/`
  - Create subdirectories: `src/`, `data/`, `ui/web/`, `ui/desktop/`, `monitors/`, `tests/`
  - Create `__init__.py` in `src/` directory
  - Expected result: Directory structure matches the layout in technical_design.md

- [ ] **Task: Create requirements.txt**
  - Create file `context-tool/requirements.txt`
  - Add dependencies with exact versions:
    ```
    fastapi>=0.104.0
    uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0
    pydantic>=2.4.0
    pyyaml>=6.0.1
    sentence-transformers>=2.2.2
    numpy>=1.24.0
    pyperclip>=1.8.2
    pynput>=1.7.6
    pytest>=7.4.0
    ```
  - Expected result: `requirements.txt` file exists with all dependencies listed

[... continues with all 7 phases and detailed tasks as I created above ...]

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] **All Phase 1 tasks completed** - Core data layer working
- [ ] **All Phase 2 tasks completed** - Pattern matching functional
- [ ] **All Phase 3 tasks completed** - Context analyzer operational
- [ ] **All Phase 4 tasks completed** - Web UI demo working
- [ ] **All Phase 5 tasks completed** - Semantic search integrated (optional)
- [ ] **All Phase 6 tasks completed** - System monitoring working (optional)
- [ ] **All Phase 7 tasks completed** - Documentation and polish done

## Notes for Code Agents

Each task is designed to be:
- **Self-contained**: Can be completed independently
- **Testable**: Success criteria clearly defined
- **Incremental**: Builds on previous tasks
- **Specific**: Exact code locations and imports specified
